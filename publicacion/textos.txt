Istán is in Málaga Province, located halfway between the Costa del Sol and the Sierra de las Nieves. Istán also enters into the Natural Park of the same name which has been declared a Biosphere Reserve. The Río Verde runs through really beautiful site  places and exceptional landscapes, like Charco del Canalón or Dehesa de Bornoque all along the territory of Istán until the Dam of la Concepción, where the Río Verde becomes the reservoir of La Concepción. And in the midst of this green paradise you can find the village, replete with fountains, gazebos and picturesque corners where the church of San Miguel and the Escalante Tower are the main heritage monuments. No doubt, Istán is known as the "Sprinwater of the Costa del Sol”

Istan is just 80 kilometers from Málaga and 15 kilometers from Puerto Banús. Given its proximity to the coastline, the journey from the coast can be done from the highway in just 20 minutes, enjoying the beautiful views of the mountain road
